## Pokemon Zero-Sum Game

hello! This is my take on the classic game of rock paper scissors. You play against the computer rival Pokemon trainer. The game is first to 3 wins! 

### Rules:
Just choose an element and the computer will choose a random element. Depending on the elements, it will show if you won or lost the round. 

Water beats fire
Grass beats water
Fire beats grass


Hope you enjoy!!
